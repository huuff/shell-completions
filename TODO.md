# Tasks
- Also add flags (`--«smth»`) to Gradle completion!
- For task completion... remove tasks that are already there? It makes no sense to put a task twice in the same invocation
- Can I add tests to this? Seems like everything I change breaks everything else

## Gradle
### `bash`
* subproject task completion

### `zsh`
* `fzf` completion for tasks
* subproject task completion
* flags completion
* flags completion with `fzf`

### `fish`
* `fzf` completion for tasks
* subproject task completion
* flags completion
* flags completion with `fzf`
